# tech-blog

I used the Mini Project to lead me in this homework assignment. I started off with the Models and Controllers. It took me awhile to understand this unit as there are so many components to it. I got it to login and the dashboard to show once logged in but couldn't find why the delete button wouldn't show. I had a TA try to help but she couldn't with the time we had. I got it to show the new blog posts on the homepage but not on the dashboard page itself.
